# daily-coding-problem

Here you can find my solutions to problems at dailycodingproblem.com.

I currently write my solutions in TypeScript. Therefore, to execute the files use:

```bash
cd code
node {filename}.ts
```

For simplicity sake I kept all files uncompiled and used Node v20.9.0 for execution. If you want to play around with the code and don't want to do it using Node locally you can visit [TS Playground](https://www.typescriptlang.org/play/?#code/Q).
