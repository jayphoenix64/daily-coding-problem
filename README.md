# daily-coding-problem

Here you can find my solutions to problems at dailycodingproblem.com.

Recommended Node version is 20.9.0 and higher and npm version 10.1.0.

I currently write my solutions in TypeScript in an npm project. Therefore, to execute the files use:

```bash
npm install  // for install all packages
npm run compile  // for compile the project
npm start // for starting the app
```

You will then be asked for the specific day you want the exercise for. Just enter a number and the output will appear.

If you want to play around with the code and don't want to do it using Node locally you can visit [TS Playground](https://www.typescriptlang.org/play/?#code/Q).
